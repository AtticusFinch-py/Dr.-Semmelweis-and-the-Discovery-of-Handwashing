# Semmelweis Handwashing Project

## Overview

This project explores the historical data collected by Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician born in 1818, who made a groundbreaking discovery about the importance of handwashing in reducing childbed fever deaths at the Vienna General Hospital in the mid-19th century.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **1. Data Exploration:**
  - Importing and examining yearly death statistics at Clinic 1 and Clinic 2.

- **2. Alarming Number of Deaths:**
  - Calculating the proportion of deaths out of the number of births and analyzing the alarming number of deaths, particularly at Clinic 1.

- **3. Death at the Clinics:**
  - Visualizing the yearly proportion of deaths at Clinic 1 and Clinic 2 to identify patterns.

- **4. The Handwashing Begins:**
  - Loading monthly data from Clinic 1 to observe the impact of handwashing.

- **5. The Effect of Handwashing:**
  - Plotting the monthly proportion of deaths to visualize the significant reduction after the implementation of handwashing.

- **6. The Effect of Handwashing Highlighted:**
  - Highlighting the period of mandatory handwashing in the graph.

- **7. More Handwashing, Fewer Deaths?:**
  - Analyzing the average reduction in the proportion of deaths due to handwashing.

- **8. Bootstrap Analysis:**
  - Performing a bootstrap analysis to estimate the uncertainty around the reduction of deaths.

- **9. The Fate of Dr. Semmelweis:**
  - Reflecting on the tragic story of Dr. Semmelweis, his groundbreaking discovery, and the challenges he faced in convincing the medical community.

## Usage

To run the analysis, make sure you have the required dependencies installed. You can use the provided Jupyter Notebook (`Semmelweis_Handwashing_Project.ipynb`) to execute the code step by step.

## Conclusion

The project concludes that Semmelweis had solid evidence that handwashing was a simple yet highly effective procedure that could save lives. Despite the evidence, his theory faced skepticism from the medical community, emphasizing the importance of data presentation and statistical analysis in scientific communication.
